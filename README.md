# kitten (a mini cat command)

A minimalistic, simple concatenate app that is aimed to be developed within the final four weeks of the AppProg module.
Each folder, session, contains the material for a week.
It contains the following:
- `main.rs` What the code should look like by the end of the week
- `main0.rs` The code that is provided at the beginning of each week.
- `mainx.rs` Represents the desired program after each major step in developement.

TODO: #4 Need to write out the description for each session and perhaps rename them to weeks!
